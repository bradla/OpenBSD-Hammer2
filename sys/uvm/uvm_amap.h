/*
 * note that am_slots, am_bckptr, and am_anon are arrays.   this allows
 * fast lookup of pages based on their virual address at the expense of
 * some extra memory.   in the future we should be smarter about memory
 * usage and fall back to a non-array based implementation on systems 
 * that are short of memory (XXXCDC).
 *
 * the entries in the array are called slots... for example an amap that
 * covers four pages of virtual memory is said to have four slots.   here
 * is an example of the array usage for a four slot amap.   note that only
 * slots one and three have anons assigned to them.  "D/C" means that we
 * "don't care" about the value.
 * 
 *            0     1      2     3
 * am_anon:   NULL, anon0, NULL, anon1		(actual pointers to anons)
 * am_bckptr: D/C,  1,     D/C,  0		(points to am_slots entry)
 *
 * am_slots:  3, 1, D/C, D/C    		(says slots 3 and 1 are in use)
 * 
 * note that am_bckptr is D/C if the slot in am_anon is set to NULL.
 * to find the entry in am_slots for an anon, look at am_bckptr[slot],
 * thus the entry for slot 3 in am_slots[] is at am_slots[am_bckptr[3]].
 * in general, if am_anon[X] is non-NULL, then the following must be
 * true: am_slots[am_bckptr[X]] == X
 *
 * note that am_slots is always contig-packed.

/*
 * defines for handling of large sparce amaps:
 * 
 * one of the problems of array-based amaps is that if you allocate a
 * large sparcely-used area of virtual memory you end up allocating
 * large arrays that, for the most part, don't get used.  this is a
 * problem for BSD in that the kernel likes to make these types of
 * allocations to "reserve" memory for possible future use.
 *
 * for example, the kernel allocates (reserves) a large chunk of user
 * VM for possible stack growth.  most of the time only a page or two
 * of this VM is actually used.  since the stack is anonymous memory
 * it makes sense for it to live in an amap, but if we allocated an
 * amap for the entire stack range we could end up wasting a large
 * amount of malloc'd KVM.
 * 
 * for example, on the i386 at boot time we allocate two amaps for the stack 
 * of /sbin/init: 
 *  1. a 7680 slot amap at protection 0 (reserve space for stack)
 *  2. a 512 slot amap at protection 7 (top of stack)
 *
 * most of the array allocated for the amaps for this is never used.  
 * the amap interface provides a way for us to avoid this problem by
 * allowing amap_copy() to break larger amaps up into smaller sized 
 * chunks (controlled by the "canchunk" option).   we use this feature
 * to reduce our memory usage with the BSD stack management.  if we
 * are asked to create an amap with more than UVM_AMAP_LARGE slots in it,
 * we attempt to break it up into a UVM_AMAP_CHUNK sized amap if the
 * "canchunk" flag is set.
 *
 * so, in the i386 example, the 7680 slot area is never referenced so
 * nothing gets allocated (amap_copy is never called because the protection
 * is zero).   the 512 slot area for the top of the stack is referenced.
 * the chunking code breaks it up into 16 slot chunks (hopefully a single
 * 16 slot chunk is enough to handle the whole stack).
