/*
 * A mutex is:
 *  - owned by a cpu.
 *  - non-recursive.
 *  - spinning.
 *  - not providing mutual exclusion between processes, only cpus.
 *  - providing interrupt blocking when necessary.
 *
 * Different mutexes can be nested, but not interleaved. This is ok:
 * "mtx_enter(foo); mtx_enter(bar); mtx_leave(bar); mtx_leave(foo);"
 * This is _not_ ok:
 * "mtx_enter(foo); mtx_enter(bar); mtx_leave(foo); mtx_leave(bar);"
