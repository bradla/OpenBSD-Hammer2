/*
 * Multiple readers, single writer lock.
 *
 * Simplistic implementation modelled after rw locks in Solaris.
 *
 * The rwl_owner has the following layout:
 * [ owner or count of readers | wrlock | wrwant | wait ]
 *
 * When the WAIT bit is set (bit 0), the lock has waiters sleeping on it.
 * When the WRWANT bit is set (bit 1), at least one waiter wants a write lock.
 * When the WRLOCK bit is set (bit 2) the lock is currently write-locked.
 *
 * When write locked, the upper bits contain the struct proc * pointer to
 * the writer, otherwise they count the number of readers.
 *
 * We provide a simple machine independent implementation that can be
 * optimized by machine dependent code when __HAVE_MD_RWLOCK is defined.
 *
 * MD code that defines __HAVE_MD_RWLOCK and implement four functions:
 *
 * void rw_enter_read(struct rwlock *)
 *  atomically test for RWLOCK_WRLOCK and if not set, increment the lock
 *  by RWLOCK_READ_INCR. While RWLOCK_WRLOCK is set, loop into rw_enter_wait.
 *
 * void rw_enter_write(struct rwlock *);
 *  atomically test for the lock being 0 (it's not possible to have
 *  owner/read count unset and waiter bits set) and if 0 set the owner to
 *  the proc and RWLOCK_WRLOCK. While not zero, loop into rw_enter_wait.
 *
 * void rw_exit_read(struct rwlock *);
 *  atomically decrement lock by RWLOCK_READ_INCR and unset RWLOCK_WAIT and
 *  RWLOCK_WRWANT remembering the old value of lock and if RWLOCK_WAIT was set,
 *  call rw_exit_waiters with the old contents of the lock.
 *
 * void rw_exit_write(struct rwlock *);
 *  atomically swap the contents of the lock with 0 and if RWLOCK_WAIT was
 *  set, call rw_exit_waiters with the old contents of the lock.
 *
 * (XXX - the rest of the API for this is not invented yet).
