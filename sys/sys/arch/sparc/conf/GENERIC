# Note the flags on the esp entries below, that work around
# deficiencies in the current driver:
#	bits 0-7:  disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding target
#	bits 8-15: disable synch negotiation for target [bit-8]
#	Note: targets 4-7 have disconnect/reselect enabled on the premise
#	      that tape devices normally have one of these targets. Tape
#	      devices should be allowed to disconnect for the SCSI bus
#	      to operate acceptably.

# NCR5380-based "Sun SCSI 3" VME SCSI controller.
# This driver has several flags which may be enabled by OR'ing
# the values and using the "flags" directive.
# Valid flags are:
#
#	0x01		Use DMA (may be polled)
#	0x02		Use DMA completion interrupts
#	0x04		Allow disconnect/reselect
#
# E.g. the following would enable DMA, interrupts, and reselect:
# si0	at vmes0 addr 0xff200000 level 3 vect 0x40 flags 0x07
#
si0	at vmes0 addr 0xff200000 level 3 vect 0x40 flags 0x01

# NCR5380-based "SCSI Weird" on-board SCSI interface found
# on sun4/100 systems.  The flags are the same as the "si"
# controller.  Note, while DMA is enabled by default, only
# polled DMA works at this time, and reselects do not work
# on this particular controller.
