/*
 * This structure maps out the global data that needs to be kept on a
 * per-cpu basis.  genassym uses this to generate offsets for the assembler
 * code.  The machine-dependant portions of this file can be found in
 * <machine/globaldata.h>, but only MD code should retrieve it.
 *
 * The SMP parts are setup in pmap.c and locore.s for the BSP, and
 * mp_machdep.c sets up the data for the AP's to "see" when they awake.
 * The reason for doing it via a struct is so that an array of pointers
 * to each CPU's data can be set up for things like "check curproc on all
 * other processors"
 *
 * NOTE! this structure needs to remain compatible between module accessors
 * and the kernel, so we can't throw in lots of #ifdef's.
 *
 * gd_reqflags serves serveral purposes, but it is primarily an interrupt
 * rollup flag used by the task switcher and spl mechanisms to decide that
 * further checks are necessary.  Interrupts are typically managed on a
 * per-processor basis at least until you leave a critical section, but
 * may then be scheduled to other cpus.
 *
 * gd_vme_avail and gd_vme_base cache free vm_map_entry structures for use
 * in various vm_map related operations.  gd_vme_avail is *NOT* a count of
 * the number of structures in the cache but is instead a count of the number
 * of unreserved structures in the cache.  See vm_map_entry_reserve().
