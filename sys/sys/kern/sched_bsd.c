 * Constants for digital decay and forget:
 *	90% of (p_estcpu) usage in 5 * loadav time
 *	95% of (p_pctcpu) usage in 60 seconds (load insensitive)
 *          Note that, as ps(1) mentions, this can let percentages
 *          total over 100% (I've seen 137.9% for 3 processes).
 *
 * Note that hardclock updates p_estcpu and p_cpticks independently.
 *
 * We wish to decay away 90% of p_estcpu in (5 * loadavg) seconds.
 * That is, the system wants to compute a value of decay such
 * that the following for loop:
 * 	for (i = 0; i < (5 * loadavg); i++)
 * 		p_estcpu *= decay;
 * will compute
 * 	p_estcpu *= 0.1;
 * for all values of loadavg:
 *
 * Mathematically this loop can be expressed by saying:
 * 	decay ** (5 * loadavg) ~= .1
 *
 * The system computes decay as:
 * 	decay = (2 * loadavg) / (2 * loadavg + 1)
 *
 * We wish to prove that the system's computation of decay
 * will always fulfill the equation:
 * 	decay ** (5 * loadavg) ~= .1
 *
 * If we compute b as:
 * 	b = 2 * loadavg
 * then
 * 	decay = b / (b + 1)
 *
 * We now need to prove two things:
 *	1) Given factor ** (5 * loadavg) ~= .1, prove factor == b/(b+1)
 *	2) Given b/(b+1) ** power ~= .1, prove power == (5 * loadavg)
 *	
 * Facts:
 *         For x close to zero, exp(x) =~ 1 + x, since
 *              exp(x) = 0! + x**1/1! + x**2/2! + ... .
 *              therefore exp(-1/b) =~ 1 - (1/b) = (b-1)/b.
 *         For x close to zero, ln(1+x) =~ x, since
 *              ln(1+x) = x - x**2/2 + x**3/3 - ...     -1 < x < 1
 *              therefore ln(b/(b+1)) = ln(1 - 1/(b+1)) =~ -1/(b+1).
 *         ln(.1) =~ -2.30
 *
 * Proof of (1):
 *    Solve (factor)**(power) =~ .1 given power (5*loadav):
 *	solving for factor,
 *      ln(factor) =~ (-2.30/5*loadav), or
 *      factor =~ exp(-1/((5/2.30)*loadav)) =~ exp(-1/(2*loadav)) =
 *          exp(-1/b) =~ (b-1)/b =~ b/(b+1).                    QED
 *
 * Proof of (2):
 *    Solve (factor)**(power) =~ .1 given factor == (b/(b+1)):
 *	solving for power,
 *      power*ln(b/(b+1)) =~ -2.30, or
 *      power =~ 2.3 * (b + 1) = 4.6*loadav + 2.3 =~ 5*loadav.  QED
 *
 * Actual power values for the implemented algorithm are as follows:
 *      loadav: 1       2       3       4
 *      power:  5.68    10.32   14.94   19.55
