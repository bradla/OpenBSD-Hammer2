/*
 * This subsystem implements most of the core support functions for
 * the hammer2_chain structure.
 *
 * Chains are the in-memory version on media objects (volume header, inodes,
 * indirect blocks, data blocks, etc).  Chains represent a portion of the
 * HAMMER2 topology.
 *
 * A chain is topologically stable once it has been inserted into the
 * in-memory topology.  Modifications which copy, move, or resize the chain
 * are handled via the DELETE-DUPLICATE mechanic where the original chain
 * stays intact but is marked deleted and a new chain is allocated which
 * shares the old chain's children.
 *
 * This sharing is handled via the hammer2_chain_core structure.
 *
 * The DELETE-DUPLICATE mechanism allows the same topological level to contain
 * many overloadings.  However, our RBTREE mechanics require that there be
 * no overlaps so we accomplish the overloading by moving conflicting chains
 * with smaller or equal radii into a sub-RBTREE under the chain being
 * overloaded.
 *
 * DELETE-DUPLICATE is also used when a modification to a chain crosses a
 * flush synchronization boundary, allowing the flush code to continue flushing
 * the older version of the topology and not be disrupted by new frontend
 * operations.
 *
 *				LIVE VS FLUSH VIEW
 *
 * All lookup and iterate operations and most modifications are done on the
 * live view.  During flushes lookups are not normally done and modifications
 * may be run on the flush view.  However, flushes often needs to allocate
 * blocks and the freemap_alloc/free code issues lookups.  This code is
 * special cased to use the live view when called from a flush.
 *
 * General chain lookup/iteration functions are NOT aware of the flush view,
 * they only know about live views.

 *     is accomplished by always recursing through matching keyspaces in
 *     the hammer2_chain_lookup() and hammer2_chain_next() API.
 *
 * The current implementation calculates the current worst-case keyspace by
 * iterating the current parent and then divides it into two halves, choosing
 * whichever half has the most elements (not necessarily the half containing
 * the requested key).
 *
 * We can also opt to use the half with the least number of elements.  This
 * causes lower-numbered keys (aka logical file offsets) to recurse through
 * fewer indirect blocks and higher-numbered keys to recurse through more.
 * This also has the risk of not moving enough elements to the new indirect
 * block and being forced to create several indirect blocks before the element
 * can be inserted.
 *
 * Must be called with an exclusively locked parent.
