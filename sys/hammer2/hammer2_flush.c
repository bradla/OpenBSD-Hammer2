 *			TRANSACTION AND FLUSH HANDLING
 *
 * Deceptively simple but actually fairly difficult to implement properly is
 * how I would describe it.
 *
 * The biggest issue is that each PFS may belong to a cluster so its media
 * modify_tid and mirror_tid fields are in a completely different domain
 * than the topology related to the super-root.
 *
 * Flushing generally occurs bottom-up but requires a top-down scan to
 * locate chains with MODIFIED and/or UPDATE bits set.  The ONFLUSH flag
 * tells how to recurse downward to find these chains.

 * test the UPDATE bit on the child to determine if the parent needs updating.
 *
 * (1) Determine if this node is a candidate for the flush, return if it is
 *     not.  fchain and vchain are always candidates for the flush.
 *
 * (2) If we recurse too deep the chain is entered onto the deferral list and
 *     the current flush stack is aborted until after the deferral list is
 *     run.
 *
 * (3) Recursively flush live children (rbtree).  This can create deferrals.
 *     A successful flush clears the MODIFIED and UPDATE bits on the children
 *     and typically causes the parent to be marked MODIFIED as the children
 *     update the parent's block table.  A parent might already be marked
 *     MODIFIED due to a deletion (whos blocktable update in the parent is
 *     handled by the frontend), or if the parent itself is modified by the
 *     frontend for other reasons.
 *
 * (4) Permanently disconnected sub-trees are cleaned up by the front-end.
 *     Deleted-but-open inodes can still be individually flushed via the
 *     filesystem syncer.
 *
 * (5) Note that an unmodified child may still need the block table in its
 *     parent updated (e.g. rename/move).  The child will have UPDATE set
 *     in this case.
