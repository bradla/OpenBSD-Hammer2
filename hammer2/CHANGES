			    DESIGN CHANGES & ISSUES

* Indirect blocks have to be fully associative (all 1024 entries) for now,
  I haven't figured out a way to break it down into smaller associative
  blocks without breaking copies.

* (temporary) all data blocks are 64K at the moment.

* currently directory cookies are non-linear.
