TODO:
	msg_lnk.c  msg_lnk_signal rescans all connections.  What we really
		   need to do is queue the conn (when possible) or the node
		   (when possible), or just flag it w/ a global, and then
		   only scan a subset.

	link->dist propagation is still a bit screwy when there are a
	lot of parallel network links.
