.Nm newfs_hammer2
.Nd construct a new HAMMER2 file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl b Ar bootsize
.Op Fl r Ar redosize
.Op Fl V Ar version
.Op Fl L Ar label
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prepares a
.Nm HAMMER2
volume on the specified block device.
.Nm HAMMER2
volumes can contain any number of named PFSs (Pseudo FileSystems).
Each named PFS can operate independently or be a constituent of
of a larger cluster.
Regardless, you must still format each block device separately using
this command.
.Pp
By default the
.Nm
program creates three local MASTER PFSs: "LOCAL", "BOOT", and "ROOT".
The "LOCAL" PFS is mandatory and is always created.  It represents an
unclustered mount point representative of the just block device you
formatted.
.Pp
The "BOOT" and "ROOT" PFSs are optional and will be created by default.
These provide convenient initially non-clustered mount points for your
boot or root filesystem.
These PFSs are not created if the
.Fl L Ar label
option is specified.
You can specify
.Fl L Ar none
if you do not want
.Nm
to create any PFSs other than "LOCAL".
.Pp
Generally speaking this command is not used to create clusters.  It is used
to format volumes which are then made available for additional clustering
commands.
Once formatted the device@LOCAL volume can be mounted in order to make the
block device available to the cluster.
You can then use
.Xr hammer2 8
directives to construct your cluster, including the creation of additional
PFSs within various volumes.
If you are managing several machines, or a large number of machines,
.Fl L Ar none
is typically specified and each machine's ROOT is individually named,
for example, "FUBAR-ROOT".
.Pp
.Nm HAMMER2
file systems are sector-size agnostic, however the
.Dx
implementation requires the sector size to be no larger than 16K.
.Nm HAMMER2
file systems start at a relative offset of 0 and leave no room for
in-band disklabels (old, traditional BSD labels).
They may only be created using out-of-band disk labels, which is the
default on
.Dx
via
.Po
.Xr disklabel 5
or
.Xr gpt 8
labels
.Pc ,
or with
old style disklabels as long as
the partition does not overlap the label area (have a starting sector
greater than 16).
.Pp
.Nm HAMMER2
file systems are designed for large storage systems, up to 1 Exabyte, and
may not operate efficiently on small storage systems.
The minimum recommended file system size is 50GB.
In addition,
.Nm HAMMER2
file systems operating normally, with automatic snapshots, do not
immediately reclaim space when files are deleted.
A regular system maintenance job runs once a day by
.Xr periodic 8
to handle reclamation.
.Pp
.Nm HAMMER2
works best when the machine's normal workload would not otherwise fill
the file system up in the course of 60 days of operation.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b Ar bootsize
Specify a fixed area in which a boot related kernel and data can be stored.
The
.Ar bootsize
is specified in bytes.
By default a boot area of approximately 4MB will be created.
.It Fl f
Force operation.
This is needed for the creation of a
.Nm HAMMER2
file system less than 10GB size or
with less than 500MB UNDO/REDO FIFO.
This should not be used under normal circumstances.
.It Fl r Ar redosize
Specify the size of the fixed REDO FIFO.
The
.Ar redosize
is specified in bytes.
By default 0.1% of the root
volume's size is used, with a reasonable minimum and a reasonable cap.
The UNDO/REDO FIFO is used to sequence meta-data out to the media for
instant crash recovery.
.It Fl V Ar version
Specify the
.Nm HAMMER2
file system version to format.
By default
.Nm
formats the file system using the highest production version number
supported by the
.Nm HAMMER2
VFS by checking the
.Va vfs.hammer2.supported_version
sysctl.
If you need to maintain compatibility with an older version of
.Nm HAMMER2
you may specify the version with this option.
.It Fl L Ar label
By default
.Nm
creates three local master PFSs on the new volume: "LOCAL", "BOOT", and "ROOT".
If you specify one or more label options
.Nm
will not automatically create "BOOT" or "ROOT".
"LOCAL" is always created and should never be specified.
If you don't want any extra PFSs to be created, use
.Fl L Ar none .
.Pp
Typically simple HAMMER2 filesystems just use the defaults and
.Fl L Ar none
is used for more complex filesystem, followed by mounting device@LOCAL
and using
.Nm hammer2
directives to create the desired cluster.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar bootsize
and
.Ar redosize
must be given with a suffix of
.Cm K , M , G
or
.Cm T
meaning kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte and terabyte.
Lower case can also be used for suffix.
These options create reserved blocks of space on the target volume
but are not currently used by the filesystem for anything.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
newfs_hammer2 -L SATURN-HOME /dev/ad0s1d
.Ed
.Pp
Create a file system named
.Sq SATURN-HOME
on
.Pa /dev/ad0s1d .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success and 1 on error.
